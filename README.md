Topic:- Zero to Snowflake Quickstart focused on Semi-Structured Data Processing!

1)	About Data
Global food truck network, localized menu options, 15 countries, 30 major cities, and 15 core brands. It is created by snowflake team as frosty tasty bytes. For this project, we used the Snowflake web interface known as Snowsight. We are doing setup by link

2)  Task:-
As a Tasty Bytes Data Engineer, we have been tasked with profiling our Menu data that includes a Semi-Structured Data column. From this menu table we need to produce an Analytics layer View that exposes Dietary and Ingredient data to our end users.

3)	What was learnt
•	What a Variant Data Type is
•	How to Use Dot Notation to Query Semi-Structured Data
•	How to Flatten Semi-Structured Data
•	How to Analyze Arrays
•	How to Create a View
•	How to Build a Chart from a Result Set in Snowsight

4)	Steps
1.	Profiling our Semi-Structured Menu Data
2.	Flattening Semi-Structured Data
3.	Creating Structured Views Over Semi-Structured Data
4.	Analyzing Processed Semi-Structured Data in Snowsight
5.	Conclusion and Next Steps
